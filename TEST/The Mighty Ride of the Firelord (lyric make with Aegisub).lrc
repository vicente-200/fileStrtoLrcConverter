[00:28.800]Cruel Akron bloody bastard I now spit on you
[00:34.460]You can turn my bones to black ash but I'll move the moon
[00:39.840]Also Dargor can't endure all... goes out from the cave
[00:45.950]while the demons take the hero for their tragic game
[00:52.130]Gods of earth save me from madness from these rites of total shame
[00:57.480]while descending in the red flame
[01:00.130]Arwald dies but not in vain
[01:02.570]They will pay for this nightmare, for the symphony of pain
[01:07.750]For Airin, my dead friend and all my crying wasted land
[01:15.330]I call the Tharos's fire
[01:20.260]I call the thunder roar
[01:25.460]Raise your voice and ride all
[01:29.370]ride all brave, raise your sword to the sky
[01:39.220]and sing the epic symphony
[01:44.150]for the mighty and proud firelord
[01:57.420]Arwald's acid broke the silver chains
[02:00.840]before his very last breath
[02:03.840]Akron laughing really doesn't know what now waits for him...
[02:10.040]Gods are raging leading my red steel
[02:13.550]heads and limbs are falling down
[02:16.330]It's in me the mystic messenger bringer of revenge
[02:28.170]"Black angel, I call you! King Chaos is raging
[02:33.800]in the torment of my heart...
[02:36.750]I call the holy earthquake to end this bloody Hell!"
[02:42.000]Gods are raging leading my red steel
[02:45.330]heads and limbs are falling down
[02:48.530]It's in me the mystic messenger bringer of revenge
[03:01.170]while she comes, beloved sunlight
[03:27.530]On the river known as Ainor
[03:30.750]our hero found his way
[03:33.330]All the demons desperately
[03:36.040]search for him now but in vain
[03:38.530]They will pay for this nightmare, for the symphony of pain
[03:43.710]For Airin, my dead friend and all my crying wasted land
[03:50.770]I call the Tharos's fire
[03:56.240]I call the thunder roar
[04:01.150]Raise your voice and ride all
[04:06.680]ride all brave, raise your sword to the sky
[04:15.910]and sing the epic symphony
[04:19.860]for the mighty and proud firelord
