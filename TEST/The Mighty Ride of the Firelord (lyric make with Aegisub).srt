   1
       00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,460
    Cruel Akron bloody bastard I now spit on you

2
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,840
   You can turn my bones to black ash but I'll move the moon

3
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,950
Also Dargor can't endure all... goes out from the cave

4
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:52,130
while the demons take the hero for their tragic game

5
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:57,480
Gods of earth save me from madness from these rites of total shame

6
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,130
while descending in the red flame

7
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,570
Arwald dies but not in vain

8
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,750
They will pay for this nightmare, for the symphony of pain

9
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:15,330
For Airin, my dead friend and all my crying wasted land

10
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,260
I call the Tharos's fire

11
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,460
I call the thunder roar

12
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,370
Raise your voice and ride all

13
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:39,220
ride all brave, raise your sword to the sky

14
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:44,150
and sing the epic symphony

15
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:56,240
for the mighty and proud firelord

16
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,840
Arwald's acid broke the silver chains

17
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,800
before his very last breath

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,040
Akron laughing really doesn't know what now waits for him...

19
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,550
Gods are raging leading my red steel

20
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,330
heads and limbs are falling down

21
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:26,620
It's in me the mystic messenger bringer of revenge

22
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,800
"Black angel, I call you! King Chaos is raging

23
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,750
in the torment of my heart...

24
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,000
I call the holy earthquake to end this bloody Hell!"

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,330
Gods are raging leading my red steel

26
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,530
heads and limbs are falling down

27
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:58,570
It's in me the mystic messenger bringer of revenge

28
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:12,950
while she comes, beloved sunlight

29
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,750
On the river known as Ainor

30
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,330
our hero found his way

31
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,040
All the demons desperately

32
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,530
search for him now but in vain

33
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:43,710
They will pay for this nightmare, for the symphony of pain

34
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:50,770
For Airin, my dead friend and all my crying wasted land

35
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:56,240
I call the Tharos's fire

36
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,930
I call the thunder roar

37
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:06,680
Raise your voice and ride all

38
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:15,910
ride all brave, raise your sword to the sky

39
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,860
and sing the epic symphony

40
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:43,770
for the mighty and proud firelord
